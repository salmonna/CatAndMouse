# Cat and Mouse Game

The project revolves around simulating a game scenario featuring a cat and a mouse. 
The primary goal is for the mouse to consume all the cheeses strategically while avoiding capture by the cats. 
Cats have the opportunity to catch the mouse up to three times. Additional game elements, 
such as keys for opening doors and gifts for earning points, enhance the overall gameplay experience.

## Data Structures:

- **Vector:** Used for managing collections of objects.
- **String:** Used for storing textual data.
- **Class:** Utilized for encapsulating related data and functions.
- **Struct:** Used for location of the objects. 


## Algorithms:


Cats pursue the mouse by moving vertically to align with the mouse's position and then giving chase.


## Design:


The central class, likely the `Controller`, takes on the responsibility of managing the game's lifecycle and
orchestrating interactions between different components. Each class appears to have a specific role, 
handling aspects such as object behavior, rendering, or game logic.
